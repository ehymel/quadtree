This is my version of the p5 project from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxEcs0w_kE&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain">Coding Challenge youtube video</a>. 

Quadtree is used to greatly reduce the burden of iterating over a large group of points as they relate to other points; it reduces the run time from n^2 to n*log(n) time.
